the Federation, Abubakar Malami’s threats on declaring a state of emergency in Anambra for a peaceful election.</p><p>Lai Mohammed said that Malami was right to take the decision as it would help in averting a national crisis.</p><p>He stated that over the past weeks IPOB mandatory sit-at-home has led to students not going to school and people being unable to successfully carry out their businesses.</p><p>The minister went ahead to state that Anambra’s situation could not be compared to the killings in the North because while the agitators in Anambra wanted to leave the country, the bandits were simply criminals that wanted to remain in Nigeria.</p><p>The presidency has maintained that President Muhammadu Buhari made no mistake when he recently claimed to have performed better than any other government since Nigeria returned to democracy in 1999.</p><p>It submitted that the Buhari administration has made tremendous progress in infrastructure, social care, and general governance more than all the previous administrations since 1999 have achieved.</p><p>This position was brought back to the timeline on Thursday by the spokesperson of the President, Femi Adesina who reiterated the position via an opinion article titled ‘weighty matters about our country‘ which he released on his Facebook page.</p><p>He made direct reference to a part of Buhari’s 2021 independence
