In it, he posted a response to another user's video showing a woman with a protruding belly performing a series of rapid standing cleans and jerks in what looks like a Crossfit style gym.</p><p>The woman he highlights in his video is actually a fitness influencer and Crossfit enthusiast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">named Beth</a> who regularly posts her own content to TikTok. She touts herself as a plus-size athlete and regularly posts clips that dispel the idea one needs to look a certain way in order to excel in physical fitness</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The video serves to dispel the rumor that the aesthetics of a person determines how fit they are, something that Ben discusses at length in his TikTok while offering up his remarks on the comments section of Beth, who recorded herself performing multiple repetitions of the exercise.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@bdccarpenter href=#>@bdccarpenter</a><p>Replying to @shelbs having a six pack is not fitness. Once again, I am tagged in a video where too many people feel comfortable insulting someone based on their body fat percentage. What @Sporty Beth CrossFit said isn’t even controversial. *Being* fit and *looking* fit are not the same thing. Many powerlifters and olympic lifters have high body fat percentages, but their sport requires them to lift X amount of weight. That is their sport. Many martial artists are not very muscular and can also have high body fat percentages, but they would decimate bodybuilders with no fight experience. Obviously, this is not to say that NOBODY who practices bodybuilding isn’t also fit. You can absolutely do both. It’s just worth keeping in mind that chasing aesthetics and chasing fitness are not always the same thing. And, I am frankly very sick of seeing really good people being insulted on their fitness videos just because they don’t look a certain way. Because if actual athletes get insulted for the way they look when they exercise, should we be surprised that so many regular people find gyms intimidating environments to be in? I propose not. P.S. my best-selling book, ‘Everything Fat Loss’ is currently on sale at Barnes and Noble, Apple, Kobo, Google, and at Amazon with an extra 29% off in Canada.

But what he said is a fact. This is a photo of me," he says, pointing to a picture of himself shirtless, gripping two 45lb dumbbells looking positively shredded.</p><p>"Many people would say that I look fit. But at the time I didn't do any cardio or play any sports. I was good at lifting weights...at a controlled tempo...in the 6-15 rep range. But my agility and fitness levels sucked.

She’s a very strong and powerful athlete. The amount of hate the poor woman gets is shocking."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another said that this was simply par the course for some sports and that Beth's body type is a lot more common in various weight-centric sports programs than people might think: "These people obviously haven’t seen some Olympians and professional athletes in some sports"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And then there were those who said that this was just a common case of people talking smack on the internet without having the slightest idea as to what they're commenting on: "I feel like the people making the cruellest comments could not go toe to toe with her. she's amazing"</p><p>One other person said that there's a clear difference between gym strength and real world strength: "My partner owns a scaffolding company and has a lot of gym guys come cause they think it’s easy… they usually quit after 3 hours"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnrunuNSepZydomKzprjTZpmerKSav27Dx56lZqSVqMBuvsipp56c</p></div><div id=links><a href=./j-y-park-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;J.Y.
