December 2021.</h2><p>Top aides of President Muhammadu Buhari in the Presidential Villa, Abuja, have contracted the dangerous coronavirus (Covid-19).</p><p>Despite the silence of the Nigerian government, it was gathered that many aides of President Buhari and top officials of government are down with the virus.</p><p>Government officials have also urged State House newspapers correspondents not to report the surge in infections at the villa.</p><p>The Federal Government has asked Nigerians to disregard reports of a possible attack on Abuja by foreign terrorists.</p><p>Naija News reports that the Nigeria Immigration Service had raised an alarm over plans by foreign insurgents to attack the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and its environs during this festive season.</p><p>In a letter issued on Thursday, the NIS said that terrorists from Mali are planning to enter the country through the Niger Republic border to launch the attack.</p><p>The federal government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari has increased the hazard allowance for doctors and other health workers in the country.</p><p>This was contained in a circular dated December 22, 2021 and signed by the Executive Chairman of the National Salaries, Wages, and Income Commission.</p><p>According to the circular which was also affirmed by the President’s personal assistant on new/digital media, Bashir Ahmad on his Facebook page on Saturday, while the government increased the allowance for doctors from ₦5,000 to between N32,000 and N40,000; other health workers like nurses, laboratory workers among others had theirs reviewed to between N15,000 and N34,000.</p><p>The Super Eagles of Nigeria interim head coach, Augustine Eguavoen, on Saturday named a 28-man squad for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.</p><p>Naija News reports that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) disclosed the provisional list of players ahead of the tournament holding in Cameroon next month.</p><p>Among those called up are; Huesca’s Kelechi Nwakali, Union Berlin’s Taiwo Awoniyi, Almeria striker Sadiq Umar and in-form Watford forward Emmanuel Dennis all made the cut.</p><p>There is however no place for Venezia’s Tyronne Ebuehi in the Super Eagles squad.</p><p>Even if he cared little about his legacy and supposed integrity, President Muhammadu Buhari should have spared a thought for Nigeria and Nigerians in his recent decision to decline assent to the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill jointly passed by the National Assembly. Nigerians and the country have given so much to Buhari to make him place the public interest above parochial interest on matters of State. As bad as it is for him to have vetoed the legislation, how he did this is disheartening and raises questions over the interest of a President who is serving out his final term in office.</p><p>After being passed by both chambers of the National Assembly, the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill, 2021 was transmitted to Buhari for assent on November 18, 2021. With time running out as to when the President must act on the bill, informed Nigerians were so beholden to the proposed legislation that they were on national television interpreting the provisions of Section 58 (4) of the 1999 Constitution to possibly extend the 30-day stipulated time frame within which the President must sign or decline assent. By last weekend, the anxiety and nerve-wracking suspense in the polity was palpable.</p><p>The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has denied a plan by members of the National Assembly to override President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.</p><p>Naija News had reported that President Buhari failed to sign the bill into law due to the compulsory use of direct primary to pick candidates.</p><p>In a letter sent to the National Assembly, Buhari said assenting to the bill may open up the electoral system to a series of litigations from party members and stakeholders.</p><p>He stated that the adoption of direct primaries violates the spirit of democracy and would fuel corruption as well as encourage the monetization of elections.</p><p>The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd (NNPC) has reacted to the pipeline explosion that rocked the Iyana-Odo/Baruwa area of Lagos State on Friday.</p><p>Recall that that electric cable had on Friday collapsed in the locality which led to sparks and the sparks got to spill petrol around the area which led to the pipeline gutting fire and a subsequent explosion.</p><p>The incident had resulted in blackouts in some parts of Lagos State.</p><p>Reacting, the Group Managing Director, NNPC Ltd., Mele Kyari, said the explosion will not affect the supply of petroleum products across the country</p><p>The Nigerian Army has released the female soldier, Sofiat Akinlabi who was detained after being proposed to by a male corps member at the National Youth Service Corps orientation camp in Kwara State.</p><p>The development was confirmed by the spokesperson of the Nigerian Army, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, on Saturday.</p><p>He said, “I can confirm to you that an order has been made for the soldier to be freed and enjoy the Christmas with her family and friends with a serious warning for her not to repeat such act again.”</p><p>Hon Reuben Izeze, a member representing Ughelli South Constituency at the Delta State House of Assembly, was Thursday night, shot by unknown gunmen at Effurun, Uvwie Local Government Area, Delta State.</p><p>Althogh, details of the attack were hazy as at of filing of this report, it was learnt that the gunmen opened fire at Izeze’s vehicle at close range.</p><p>It was gathered that the lawmaker survived the attack and is currently receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital.</p><p>Senate President Ahmad Lawan has expressed hope that President Muhammadu will sign the 2022 appropriation bill next week.</p><p>Lawan made this known in an interview with State House correspondents after meeting with the President at the Presidential Villa in Abuja on Friday.</p><p>Naija News reports the Senate and the House of Representatives had earlier in the week passed the 2022 budget and increased the estimate to N17.13 trillion.</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
