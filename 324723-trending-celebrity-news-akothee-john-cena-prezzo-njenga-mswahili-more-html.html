Nikafikisha nine months vizuri but after kujifungua mtoto hakulia, tayari alikua amefariki. Nilishindwa kulia wala kuongea;yaani sikujua cha kufanya. After hiyo miezi yote uchungu mwingi natoka hossy bure, Zeddy disclosed.<p class=align-left>Her trouble didn’t end here as she also faced stigma in the maternity ward she was admitted.</p>So after kupoteza mtoto unawekwa ward moja na mama na watoto wao sema stress kila mmoja ananyonyesha.

Eric Omondi discloses how comedian Njenga Mswahili suffered before his death</h3><p class=align-left>Big Tyme Entertainment CEO Eric Omondi has let the cat out of the bag about the troubles Anthony Njenga, better known as Njenga Mswahili went through before his demise.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c215070dfb3924b6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Simba Mwenyewe: Hamo Spends Quality Time with 2nd Wife Jemutai</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Speaking in an interview with a local radio station, Eric revealed that the late comedian was never okay for the last three years. He stated that Njenga would seek help from his friends and other people.</p><p class=align-left>Omondi cited that he one day even did some shopping for him. However, he didn’t bother to know what Njenga was going through. For this reason, he partly blames himself for assuming that the late comedian would manage to navigate through all his problems alone.</p><p class=align-left>According to Omondi, celebrities, especially comedians struggle to maintain a particular image in front of their fans and social media opting to suffer in silence.</p>Njenga Mswahili was not okay for nearly three years. He sought help from different people, including myself. He approached me on two or three occasions for assistance. I helped where I could. The last time I bumped into him, he told me that he had gotten saved, and was preaching at Junction area in Dagoretti. I asked him to get into the supermarket and pick the things that he needed, which he did. I settled the bill, revealed Omondi.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/30a3481ed379ad8f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Women Say They'd Rather Be Career Moms than Stay-At-Home Mothers: "Sitaki Madharau"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A few months later, Eric got to know that Njenga Mswahili was being arrested on theft grounds. At that instance, he knew that Njenga was undeniably battling with a lot of depression.</p>I was shocked, given I knew he was born again. Much later, I learned that he was suffering depression. This is something that very many people knew, but today, life is akin to how people get fast-food meals. Somebody could be shouting for help, but no one cares to help. It is like we have lost every shred of humanity that we had, Omondi said.<p class=align-left>Talking about how celebrities struggle to maintain a particular public image, Big Tyme Entertainment CEO referenced the instances when he was very famous and had made it on the TV but was using public transport as he couldn’t afford to buy a car.</p>When you are a celebrity who has a big name with no money, then chances are high you would suffer depression, given the lifestyle you’re living is not mirroring your status as a public figure, said Omondi.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4239eff9386598e2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Men Disclose What Happened to Them after Being Caught Ogling at Other Women: "Slap"</span></p></a><h3>3.

She cited that their breakup was going to go viral over the internet as they were in an open relationship.</p>It is to be expected because we put our lives out there, and our online ‘in-laws’ who were also invested in the relationship were and are still curious to know what happened. I’m still dealing with it. It takes time to come to terms with a breakup because of the physical and emotional toll… it feels almost like grief because I feel like I’ve lost someone who ideally I wanted to grow old with. It took me to a really dark place, and it’s definitely not the way I envisioned things, Maureen said.<p class=align-left>Sometime last year, the couple broke the internet, and all the airwaves after their maternity shoot attracted a lot of speculations on top of their existing YouTube fame.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/60d25d73bef021a4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nyota Ndogo Grateful to God as Mzungu Hubby Buys Her New BMW: "Wanasema Nimemroga"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After fans noticed that the two were not uploading pictures of themselves together, they prompted Frankie to speak about the matter and set the record straight about their relationship.</p><p class=align-left>Recently, reports of Frankie moving on with Natalie Tewa have been circulating over all the social media platforms. Some fans wondered why he had moved on so fast. However, furious, Frankie took to Instagram to clear the air about the matter.</p>Good morning guys, just want to address a few things. There has been rumours and speculations which we tried to ignore, but it’s getting out of hand. Not every woman that I talk to, work with or post is in a relationship with me. Kindly let us be mature about this. Natalie Tewa... This story is too farfetched.The point of this is to let you know that people might say something to be funny or relevant on Twitter and Instagram, but someone’s day to day life is being affected. We are not in a good place yet. I have known Maureen for 6 years and loved her every one of those years. That kind of love doesn’t fade. Sometimes things just don’t happen the way you expect them to. Our main focus is the kids and creating a healthy environment for them.

This man fought for me in court as if he was my father, he kept court dates like he was the mother of the child, try tell him anything negative about Akothee you will be outside the door! He treats the two boys equally like the 3 girls too, he refers to my children as our children, Dominic is more of a father to me. It has never changed, even when we broke up 2015 I am still his MPENZI YANGU, Akothee affirmed.<h3>6.
