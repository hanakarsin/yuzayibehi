class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Updated May 12 2020, 11:52 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>When <a href=#>Charli D'Amelio</a> and Chase Hudson aka lilhuddy were dating, it was the biggest relationship on TikTok. They are among two of the biggest names on the app (Charli has the most followers), and they collaborated on content and teased their romance to fans.&nbsp;</p><p>Charli and Chase are also both members of <a href=#>Hype House, a residence collective</a> of some of TikTok's biggest stars — including Thomas Petrou, Addison Rae, and Patrick Huston.&nbsp;</p><p>While <a href=#>Hype House</a> has gotten negative press recently as a result of founding member Daisy Keech's dramatic exit, for the most part, it has boosted the careers of its members.&nbsp;</p><p>With the April 2020 announcement that Charli and Chase had broken up (but were choosing to remain friends), many wondered if Charli and sister Dixie D'Amelio would soon exit the collective.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>After all, Charli is TikTok's No. 1 star, and Chase's father is the one whose name is on the Hype House deed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Charli D'Amelio leaving Hype House? </a>The D'Amelio sisters confirmed their fate in the house, and it may have lost two of its biggest stars. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Charli D'Amelio leaving Hype House?</h2><p>While being in the Hype House has only benefited the fame of most of its members, it was clear from its inception that Charli did not need to be part of it to get followers. When she joined the group in early 2020, she was already on the list of the top 10 most followed TikTok accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>After Chase was accused of cheating on Charli by sliding into the DMs of Nessa Barrett (who is dating <a href=#>TikTok star Josh Richards</a>), the couple announced their split on April 13 via their Instagram stories.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"Since you guys have watched mine and Chase's relationship from the start, I decided I needed to tell you all that we are no longer together," Charli wrote on her Instagram account. "It hurts me to say this, but we've decided that this is what's best for both of us. We are still close friends, and I would not change that for anything! I truly have so much love for Chase, and wish nothing but the best for him!"</p><p>"It makes me so happy to see all of the great things he has going for him. I'm sorry I waited so long to tell you all," she continued. "I wanted to take the time to process it for myself. Breakups are tough for anyone, so I'd really rather not talk about it anymore."</p><p>On the same day, Chase also confirmed the breakup on his Instagram stories. He reiterated that he and Charli would remain friends, and that he also wanted fans to respect his privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>Since revealing that they broke up, rumors have been rampant that Charli and Dixie would soon announce that they parted ways with Hype House. Chase is a founding member of the collective, plus he fronted much of the cash for the deposit on the house, and his dad's name is the only one on the deed, so it would make sense that Charli would be the one to leave the group (though she has the most star power).&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>After weeks of speculation, a representative for the D'Amelio family confirmed that Dixie and Charli were leaving the Hype House in a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter </a>on May 6.&nbsp;</p><p>"When the Hype House started to become more of a business, Charli and Dixie stepped away from that aspect," their rep stated. "While their businesses are separate, their friendships with the members continue."</p><p>While the D'Amelio family's statement hinted at a separation from the Hype House for business reasons, there are also rumors that the family will be getting their own reality show.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, Charli explained that her family, which also includes parents Heidi and Marc D'Amelio — would definitely be interested in showing their home life on TV.&nbsp;</p><p>"I mean, definitely something that would be super fun [would be] for people to kind of see what goes on when we're not just posting TikToks," Charli said. "I feel like no one really gets to see, but, people are always talking about how they think our family dynamic is pretty cool."</p><p>Marc confirmed that something was already in the works.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>"We're figuring out all that stuff right now. This has all kinda happened all really quickly. But we think if we're gonna do it, we'll go all in with it," he said. "And like Charli said, let everyone get to know us a little bit more closely. So, we're in the process of working it out right now."</p><p>Further information about a D'Amelio family reality series has not yet been released.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">TikTok stars Bryce Hall and Josh Richards said Chase treated Charli terribly.</h2><p>Though Chari and Chase both said that they are staying friends following their big breakup, several TikTok stars are claiming that Chase let fame affect the way he treated Charli. Josh Richards and Bryce Hall are both members of Sway House, which is a collective similar to Hype House.</p><p>After Chase allegedly got flirty with Josh's girlfriend, Nessa Barrett, Josh and Bryce released a diss track targeted at Chase. In "Still Softish," the two said that Chase was nothing without Charli, and they confirmed that Chase reached out to Nessa while he was still with Charli.</p><p>Shortly after the song and music video were released, the Instagram account <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTokRoom</a> obtained a screen recording of a Skype interview with Bryce and Josh.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Well yikes 😬😬😬☕️...

"And she's so young, so she doesn't know what complete sh-t really feels like. And I'm not trying to talk too much s--t on Chase, but he was being a d--k. He was not a good boy for her."</p><p>Josh said that Chase has changed because of the high level of fame he's gotten from TikTok.</p><p>"He's just sadly a kid that used to have a really great heart and used to be a really outstanding kid. He was one of my best friends, but I think what happened over time is that the numbers sadly got to him," Josh said. "And then, I think that he realized it at a point too, but it was just almost too late..."</p><p>Whether Charli saw this interview or listened to the song is unknown at this time.&nbsp;</p><p>You can listen to Josh and Bryce's diss track below and see the music video that directly shades Chase.
