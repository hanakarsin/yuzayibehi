I always had it, but refused to release it, so that those venting spleen on it could please themselves.”</p><p>The ex-president was quoted as saying in chapter 5 of a book authored by his former media adviser, Femi Adesina.</p><p>Recalling when the WAEC Registrar, alongside his officials, came to present the attestation certificate to Buhari in November 2018, Adesina quoted him as saying, “It would have been impossible for me to attend the Defence Services Staff College, India (1973) and thereafter, United States Army War College, as a Nigerian military officer if I didn’t sit for the WASC examinations in 1961.”</p><p>He recounted that during his high school days, it was very difficult to commit examination fraud, even though it was not impossible.</p><p>Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Olayemi Cardoso projects that the country’s inflation will drop to 21.4 per cent in 2024.</p><p>Naija News reports that Cardoso made the projection while delivering his keynote address at the macroeconomic forecast report for 2024 presented by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group.</p><p>He asserts that the government would combat inflation, which reached 28.9% in December, with the aid of inflation targeting. He hinted that lower rates might eventually impact businesses.</p><p>He said, “Inflationary pressures are expected to decline in 2024 due to the CBN’s inflation-targeting policy, which aims to rein in inflation to 21.4 per cent.”</p><p>“The outlook for decreasing inflation in 2024 will have a profound impact on businesses, providing a more predictable cost environment and potentially leading to lower policy rates, stimulating investment, fueling growth, and creating job opportunities.”</p><p>The Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Ali Ndume has warned that there will be political consequences if President Bola Tinubu fails to reverse the decision of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to move its key departments from the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to Lagos State.</p><p>Recall that the CBN had directed the relocation of some units to Lagos in a bid to decongest the Abuja headquarters.</p><p>The development has triggered controversy as some Nigerians, particularly Northerners, outrightly rejected the move, insisting that it was a plan to further under-develop the Northern region.</p><p>Reacting to the development during an appearance on Channels Television on Tuesday, Ndume, who represents Borno South, opined that the decision was not well thought out and expressed confidence that it would be reversed.</p><p>The Governor Godwin Obaseki-led Edo State Government has berated the State’s Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, revealing that he was present at the exco meeting when approval was given for the renovation of the Govt House Chapel.</p><p>Naija News reports that images of Shaibu had flooded the internet, showing the Deputy Governor holding a mass in the open and not in the State Govt House Chapel.</p><p>Some reports had claimed that a directive from the governor hindered Shaibu and his family, clerics, and other officials from observing the service at their usual spot in the chapel.</p><p>Photos published online on Tuesday morning showed the deputy governor and 2024 governorship candidate at an open field along Commercial Avenue, with his wife, civil servants from his office, some aides, and political associates in attendance.</p><p>Reacting to the outcry the images of the Deputy Governor had elicited, SSA, Religious Matters, and Pastor-in-Charge, Edo State Government House Chapel, Rev’d Osagie Ehrunmwunse, asked Shaibu to focus on his gubernatorial campaign and stop profaning God’s name.</p><p>He stated that Shaibu has unfortunately continued to stir controversy over the renovation of the Interdenominational Government House Chapel.</p><p>According to him, the Deputy Governor is trying to use things that “we as Nigerians and Edo people see and hold as sacred, such as religion, to whip up political sentiments.”</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
