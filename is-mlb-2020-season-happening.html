The league said it was going to evaluate, as time went on, to see if they were going to cancel the whole season or if it would be a delayed start.&nbsp;</p><p>“This is an unprecedented time and this is certainly an unprecedented decision that was made in the best interest of players, fans and communities across the country,” Marlins CEO Derek Jeter said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>MLB has announced that further Spring Training games have been cancelled and that Opening Day will be delayed by at least 2 weeks. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/twmHWOsM2p</a></p>— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) <a href=#>March 12, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Now that more places are opening up, is the MLB 2020 season happening?</h2><p>While the organization previously said that there would "100 percent" be a season this year, it's not looking like it will happen. There have been negotiations ongoing between Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association to come to some form of agreement on how the 2020 MLB season was going to look – discussing things like season length, pay, and all that. &nbsp;</p><p>In early June 2020, commissioner Rob Manfred <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> a season would be happening.

On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">June 15</a>, Rob walked back his previous statement and said he's "not confident" baseball will be played this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking with Mike Greenberg for ESPN's "The Return of Sports" special, Rob said, "I had been hopeful that once we got to common ground on the idea that we were gonna pay the players full prorated salary, that we would get some cooperation in terms of proceeding under the agreement that we negotiated with the MLBPA on March 26."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Major League Baseball Players Association Executive Director Tony Clark today released the following statement: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/d1p3Oj4K70</a></p>— MLBPA Communications (@MLBPA_News) <a href=#>June 13, 2020</a></figure><p>He continued, "Unfortunately, over the weekend, while Tony Clark was declaring his desire to get back to work, the union's top lawyer was out telling reporters, players and eventually getting back to owners that as soon as we issued a schedule - as they requested - they intended to file a grievance claiming they were entitled to an additional billion dollars. Obviously, that sort of bad-faith tactic makes it extremely difficult to move forward in these circumstances."&nbsp;</p><p>It seems one of the biggest sticking points is players want to be paid their full salaries, even though a full 2020 MLB season is unlikely. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuucubZGtoYmV6tLHArKanZZiWvbGxzaKloA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jalen-rose-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jalen Rose - Age, Family, Bio</a>
