But when a letter starts, "I'd be lying if I said I was surprised to hear that you died on us," one would hope that the message can only go up from there. Instead, it gets a lot worse.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# readability=1><p>View this post on Instagram</p></a><p><a href=#>Mac Miller I’d be lying if I said I was surprised to hear that you died on us. Not because you were necessarily troubled, but because you were special and because of that, you were troubled. At your peak, you were the archetypal rapper all of us wanted to be; which was independent. But also just a kid with really bright eyes about life. I’ll keep it short because I want to continue our conversation for when it’s my time to go. But I think what made you and I special is that we weren’t always on the best terms. So I didn’t always have great things to say about you. When we were on the GO:OD AM tour, I played you my album “and after that we didn’t talk”, and you thought it was absolutely incredible. I released it under the“Soulection” label and the single for my album was called “Unique” ft. Anderson Paak, and that was your favorite song at the time. You loved it so much that you made the entire tour party listen to it, and surprised me with a cake after my set. I always thought you drove yourself insane about your own music. So much that, you would adopt styles as homage to those around you that you loved. That’s where our problem started. Divine Feminine was an actual blueprint of “and after that we didn’t talk”. Your single was called “Dang!” Ft. Anderson Paak...you had Souelction support you on the Divine Feminine tour and when I tried to contact you, about anything at all...you never hit me. A close mutual friend ended up just hittin’ my DJ saying “listen man, we love Link, but we just had to do what we had to do. And Mac said if he needs a verse at anytime, he got him” We are family, you could always call me. Afterwards, we seen each other at Coachella, and you put your head down like an innocent child, but I told you to pick it up and I hugged you like the brother you are to me. You were the first person brave enough to openly say “he’s dope.”, and gave me a platform. That meant more to me than anything else. 3 days before you died, I remember pullin up on you at the crib, walking in the house and seeing the Divine Feminine album plaque on the wall. I was so proud of you and what YOU created for yourself. And I’m forever grateful for that</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>GoldLink</a> (@goldlink) on Nov 26, 2019 at 5:22pm PST</p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Throughout the letter, he discusses (and name drops) his album and his single and goes on to say that Mac's "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Divine Feminine</a>" album was an "actual blueprint" of his own album. He also suggests that Mac copied his idea for his single as both his song and Mac's feature the same artist, Anderson .Paak. He then claims that Mac ghosted him and hid from him "like an innocent child" and then goes on to say that he was the one to bury the hatchet by hugging him at Coachella.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So how are people taking the allegations made by GoldLink that Mac stole from him?</h2><p>Not well. Before we get into fan reaction, there's a response that was posted, but has since been deleted, by the rapper who was pulled into the discussion just because he worked with both GoldLink and Mac. Anderson .Paak's Instagram post dragged GoldLink, calling him "narcissistic" and "jealous."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anderson .Paak let the choppa sing on this post cause i aint NEVER seen him like this😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Goldlink shouldve left his shit in the drafts. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kRoOCsL9o3</a></p>— Mugen’s Baby Momma (@OhHeyCassidy) <a href=#>November 27, 2019</a></figure><p>He called the letter a ploy for attention and way to self-promote his work. But ultimately he took great offense that he chose to do it now, when Mac can no longer defend himself.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Fans are calling for the rapper's cancellation, with some fans even taking <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">screenshots of themselves deleting any music</a> they have of his. But the general consensus is that GoldLink could have and should have kept this to himself because Mac is no longer here to speak about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>what upsets me the most about this Goldlink situation</p><p>1. Mac isn’t here to defend himself</p><p>2. that shit is PUBLIC on the internet which means Mac’s family will likely see it</p><p>3. Mac did so much to help this dude/his career and now he comes out of no where with this disrespect</p>— Mac Miller Forever (@llisonbyrd) <a href=#>November 27, 2019</a></figure><p>Whether you believe that GoldLink's "and after that we didn’t talk" sounds like Mac's "Divine Feminine" or not, it's hard not to see fans' point that perhaps it wasn't right to publicly call someone out a year after they passed. Whether or not GoldLink addresses the controversy he caused is yet to be seen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLytsMuipaRlnJrBtbHRZqSam12itq24xKs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./lady-bunny-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Lady Bunny - Age, Family, Bio</a>
