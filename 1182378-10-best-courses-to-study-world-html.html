These courses are centered around:</p><ul><li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and technology;</li><li>Health care: healthcare delivery and management; and</li><li>Climate and environmental sustainability.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Legit.ng gathered insights from the career expert that any course revolving around the above-listed fields is gaining popularity due to present-day realities across the globe. Stanley explained:</p>We must first understand that we live in a society that is ever-evolving, which means that dynamics will always change. What is obtainable now might not be obtainable in the next 2 or 3 years; in that, we might have improvements in the quality or in the demands of what was available at this time.&nbsp;And what I'm trying to say is that because of societal demands, and present reality in the world today, it kind of has a direct impact on the kind of courses people want to go for. You would understand that because of the emergence and advancement of technology, there has been a huge demand for technological-oriented courses.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/35e00091b8ec8df8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“Loan or equity”: Expert advice on best source of capital for new business</span></p></a><h3 id=1182378-why-the-popularity-of-these-top-courses class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Why the popularity of these top courses?</h3><p class=align-left>Stanley further explained that the reason behind the popularity and relevance of these three industry-wide courses in today’s job market stems from a global shift to focus on issues such as poverty alleviation, education, gender equality, and sustainability. He said:</p>When we talk about the global job market or the global labor market, we should look at what is happening internationally. If we look at the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Millennium Development Goals</a> (MDGs), courses and careers around these areas will also emerge because they are trying to achieve the goal.&nbsp;<p class=align-left>Stanley referenced a report released by the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">World Economic Forum</a> (WEF) last year, predicting the <a href=#>future</a> of jobs from 2023 to 2027/2028. He elaborated:</p>In that report, they did say that factors like geopolitical dynamics, economic indicators, environmental sustainability, the emergence and advancement of technology, gender equality, and demographic shifts – are things that different nations in the world experience. And because of those experiences, they create a kind of economic demand in their nations, which then opens a pathway for different careers to emerge or different careers to become more popular.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/3cd90d8018e33cd4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to successfully run a business in Nigeria – Wole Ogundare, Carthena Advisory CEO</span></p></a>For instance, the world is tilting towards artificial intelligence and technology; people are trying to see how they can use AI and technology to make their lives better and their work easier. If we consider all of these dynamics, it means that courses that involve artificial intelligence and technology will be popular.&nbsp;The same goes for healthcare. When there is a health crisis worldwide, we need people who have specialized and advanced training in administering health care. Because of these dynamics, some of these courses and careers become popular in different parts of the world.&nbsp;<h2 id=1182378-expert-tips class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Expert Tips</h2><h3 id=1182378-prospects-and-career-opportunities-for-graduates class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Prospects and career opportunities for graduates</h3><p class=align-left>According to Stanley, the prospects and career opportunities for graduates of these top courses on a global scale will largely depend on demand. He also highlighted the challenges graduates face in translating theoretical knowledge into practical applications. Stanley said:</p>Just like you have a common knowledge of economics, demand will always affect supply. And you must also understand that each nation has its own peculiar dynamics. For instance, in a country like Nigeria, we are battling common issues such as electricity—our national grid collapsing every two market days—so it really affects how technology emerges and advances in the country, because of that, the demand might be low.&nbsp;<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/c75f91cc42f2b927.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>After Kenya’s protest, FG makes important proposition on new tax for the poor</span></p></a>I was talking to some people a while ago, and they were talking about how they went through all the theories in school (theoretical knowledge), and they are now facing the real world, and it's now difficult for them to exchange the theories they have for practical demonstration. I believe the projection will be that if a course or a career path cannot ordinarily be translated into practical modes and practical methods, then it becomes very problematic. It would also affect the availability of these jobs and the willingness of students, whether they are undergraduates or graduates.&nbsp;<h3 id=1182378-international-opportunities-for-students-in-these-top-courses class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>International opportunities for students in these top courses</h3><p class=align-left>Stanley advised students pursuing courses in AI and technology, healthcare, and climate and environmental sustainability to take advantage of opportunities from international organizations dedicated to making education and practical skills accessible to different nations, especially third-world countries. He pointed out that these international organizations often partner with universities to offer scholarships (full-time/part-time) to Nigerians and Africans. He recommended:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/139a05fe68f2743f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>'Not crazy to be optimistic' on climate tech, Gates tells investors</span></p></a>You must be in the right catchment area to see these opportunities. If you do not expose yourself to the kind of information you are looking for, then it becomes difficult for you to assess those opportunities.&nbsp;I hear people say, ‘Opportunities do not exist, or there are no opportunities for me to upscale or to get the required skill or to advance my skill or to get the required educational knowledge that would help me in my choosing a career path or course.’ But I think that's not true.&nbsp;The thing is, if you want to advance, how badly do you want it? You don't just wait for people to give you a long list of organizations that are ready to come into partnership with the country in terms of offering scholarships and all that.&nbsp;You go look for that information, go online, and check—you should have the keywords you are looking for and the kind of place you want to go to. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/3024909623c93d42.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>'Not a lab experiment': climate tech CEO on green innovation</span></p></a>You also need to seek knowledge, update yourself, and accept responsibility.
