Some theories contend that dreams help people store important memories they have learned and at the same time, get rid of the unimportant memories.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/22600a4b91663384.jpeg><p class=align-left>There is no one way to look at why you keep dreaming about the same person. This is because it can be someone you love most or someone you loathe in equal measure. Sometimes, you might start having doubts about whether you are losing your mind.</p><h2>Why do I keep dreaming about the same person?</h2><p class=align-left>What does it mean to dream about the same person over and over again? Could it be that the person you dream about is plotting something evil about you? Or is it that the person is meant to be the love of your life? Here are some clues as to why you keep dreaming about the same person:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f92a7375fca21db2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dreaming about someone trying to hurt you? What it means</span></p></a><h3>1. You like the person so much, you wish they were a part of your life</h3><p class=align-left>Dreams reflect your thoughts. One of the simplest ways to explain recurrent dreams is to observe that you like this person very much. Since you are constantly thinking about that person, the same continues even in your sleep.</p><p class=align-left>In some instances, you may not be aware that you like the individual. It is the recurrent dreams that help you realize your true feelings regarding the person. As the dream repeats itself, it acts as an encouragement to approach this person and communicate your true feelings.</p><p class=align-left>The more you continue having the same dream, the more you will get the courage to fulfil your desires. You never know what might happen but should you get rejected, at least you would have tried. It will give you some closure so that the thoughts are eliminated, and you will stop dreaming about that person.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/53ed652295adc9e5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does dreaming that someone is pregnant actually mean?</span></p></a><h3>2. You are guilty because of how you have behaved towards the person</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f92a7375fca21db2.jpeg><p class=align-left>Sometimes, you may keep dreaming about the same person because you are experiencing feelings of guilt. You probably did something wrong to the person, and now you can't help regretting it. It may also be that your behaviour towards this person was wanting or you failed to do something. The recurring dream is because you don't know where to start to repay or correct your wrongdoing.</p><p class=align-left>As a result, the subconscious sends you the dreams to remind you that you have to resolve the matter to find relief. If for some reason you can’t find a way to amend your wrongdoings, try to talk to the other party and apologize. If the person you keep dreaming about is dead, forgive yourself and try to move on with life.</p><h3>3. You spend a lot of time with the person or keep seeing him often</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c47f8a3ed8840892.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>40+ long paragraphs for your crush to express your feelings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>One of the reasons you keep dreaming about the same person is to see him or her way too much. The person could be close to you, such as a sibling or your best friend. Your dreams are a continuation of your daily events with the person. They act as a reflection of your reality; hence they carry no special meaning with them.</p><p class=align-left>Is it true that if you dream of someone, they dream of you? It might be the case because the other person also spends most of their time with you. In this case, there are no underlying psychological issues that you have to deal with. If you stop seeing this person as often, then the dreams' frequency will also drop in equal measure.</p><h3>4. You wish for the person to be alive again</h3><p class=align-left>Another reason you could be dreaming about someone is if the person is dead. People tend to have recurring dreams about the people they love most, especially the departed ones. In this case, the dreams serve a purpose of revealing your deep sorrow, sadness and grief.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9220fd22f42009c9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ powerful quotes that hit hard because they are deep and true</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You desire to see them come back to life and reflect your inability to accept that the person is gone forever. Most people cope with losing their loved ones through their memories, and intense thoughts give rise to dreams. The dreams console and help create a pleasant feeling as if they interact with the departed loved ones.</p><h3>5. You miss the person</h3><p class=align-left>It is human nature to dream about the people you miss, such as a close friend. If a person you have been used to is no longer near, you are bound to think about them a lot. Those thoughts will also be present in your sleep in the form of dreams.</p><p class=align-left>If you have had recurring dreams about the same person, find out if that person lives in the same town as you. You desperately desire to see the person and only after that will the dreams disappear. They act as a reminder to organize a meeting with the person to catch up on the lost time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/702f949ea511d852.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>When to leave a relationship: 15 signs you should give up on him</span></p></a><h3>6. The person reminds you of something</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/53ed652295adc9e5.jpeg><p class=align-left>Dreaming about the same person every night could only be a trigger for some other memory. That person may be a reminder of things that are important to you. Perhaps it could be a period of your life when you and the other person used to hang together.</p><p class=align-left>Dreaming of that person is a way of your subconscious trying to revive some feelings that you used to experience during that period. In most cases, you will have good memories that give you feelings of happiness and satisfaction.</p><h3>7. The person is the main actor of your recurring nightmares</h3><p class=align-left>Nightmares illuminate our worst fears, and when they are about someone, they can recur night after night. In this case, the person you have nightmares about can be someone you know well or a stranger. Such dreams are often a reflection of terrifying events from the past that are coming back to haunt you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/53d302b45e0254d6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 16 funny numbers to call when you are bored or for pranks</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The people involved tend to appear because your subconscious is replaying the event it cannot deal with. This can happen long after the experience and may call for professional help to put the event behind you.</p><h3>8. A messy breakup</h3><p class=align-left>You could have been in a relationship that was cut short by an ugly breakup. This could have deeply impacted your emotions negatively; hence, you keep dreaming about the same person. Not being able to get over the breakup can be the catalyst for your recurring dreams about that person.</p><p class=align-left>The dream could be of a particular scenario such as a fight or a time when the two of you were happy together. Through the dreams, you can reconcile with the other person or seek counselling to move on with your life.</p><p class=align-left>If you were asking, "Why do I keep dreaming about the same person over and over?" now you know. Dreams are a way of the brain, telling you that it does not rest even when sleeping. Dreams range anywhere from immensely satisfying, to bittersweet and even terrifying.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/582612be59111409.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ cute contact names for your boyfriend in your phone</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> shared an article on why you <a href=#>attract toxic people</a>.
