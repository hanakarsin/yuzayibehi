He said:</p>For instance, my wife wants to hear things like, "My dear, can we go out?" Also, she wants me to ask her about what she needs. Even though you don't provide it now, she wants me to be concerned about her needs.Of course, other women necessarily want to feel attached to you. There is a woman I know as a counselor; all she wants her husband to do is show her attention. For example, if they are at home, she wants to be close to her husband, even to sit on his legs, or if they are walking together, she wants her husband to hold her hands. Everybody has that, too, as a way of expressing themselves.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/98c2054f0f6cb9c0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ wedding vows for him: Find the right words for your special day</span></p></a><h2 id=1138139-significance-of-personal-expressions-of-love class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Significance of personal expressions of love</h2><p class=align-left>Dr. Sam emphasizes the importance of personalized expressions of love, noting that women often appreciate being "renewed and reminded of certain things." This explains the significance of conveying affection uniquely to spouses, girlfriends, or partners to make them feel unique and loved. He said:</p>My wife is very dynamic and hardworking; I find it difficult to do anything at home because whenever I intend to do something, I discover that she has already done it.I visited a friend in Port-Harcourt, which changed my life for good. During that visit, he does things at home, such as fetching water, changing diapers, and washing the children's clothes. The only thing his wife does is cook for him and his family. I was wondering why my friend would do that.Despite all my friend does, his wife said she doesn't feel he is romantic enough. I asked her what she meant by that, and she replied, "My husband doesn't even tell me that he loves me." When I asked which one she prefers between saying he loves you or showing that he loves you, she said it is meant to be both.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/180f6659fb17a3db.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Van Vicker: Ghanaian actor thanks God as he turns 46, Ghanaians wish him happy birthday</span></p></a>From that visit to my friend, I went to pick up my wife and children's clothes and began to wash them. Even from that moment, I made a roster that every month, I must cook twice for my family and that I needed to make contributions in my home because I felt my friend was doing something right that I was not doing.Sincerely speaking, women are people who always love to hear. It is not just to show that you love them but always emphasize (saying) that you love them. This is to reassure them that everything is okay because no matter what you show them, it doesn't make sense without saying it. They love touching their emotions, such as when they want you to bring them out of their mood.<h3 id=1138139-short-and-sweet-words-to-make-her-cry class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Short and sweet words to make her cry</h3><p class=align-left>Here are sweet things to say to your girlfriend in a text.
