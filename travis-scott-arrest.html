A source familiar with the situation revealed that the confrontation occurred after Travis became increasingly frustrated with the guard due to “multiple days of being chased and harassed by paparazzi” in Paris.</p><p>When hotel security intervened, TMZ reported that Travis was arrested for "violence against a security guard" employed by the Georges V hotel. He was later seen being taken away in an ambulance after several vases were shattered at the scene. The media outlet says no charges have been filed against Travis as of yet.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Travis has been arrested before.</h2><p>Travis was booked at the Miami-Dade County jail at 4:35 a.m. on June 20, 2024, and is facing charges of trespassing on property after being given a warning and disorderly intoxication, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>.</p><p>A $650 bond was issued in Travis's case, and he was arrested at 1:44 a.m., about three hours before he was booked.</p><p>According to police, Travis was on a charter boat and was involved in a dispute with the crew.</p><p>Officers were called to the marina, and Travis was asked to leave. He left when asked, but returned and got into another dispute with the crew. This time, he refused when he was asked to leave and was then arrested.</p><p>This isn't the first time that Travis has been accused of disorderly conduct.</p><p>Then, in 2015, when Travis was very much an artist on the rise, he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">arrested for disorderly conduct</a> after he ignored security warnings at Lollapalooza and encouraged the crowd to rush the stage.</p><p>That same year in Sweden, he encouraged the crowd to assault a man who had taken Travis's shoe while he was crowd-surfing.</p><p>In 2017, he was arrested for the third time for a similar incident to the one at Lollapalooza at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a concert in Arkansas</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by flame (@travisscott)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram/@travisscott</span></figure><p>Travis's rowdy crowds, and his frequent encouragement of those crowds, culminated in the <a href=#>deaths of 10 people</a> during a crowd surge at Travis's Astroworld Festival performance in November of 2021.</p><p>A grand jury declined to indict Travis over the incident, but <a href=#>a lawsuit was filed on behalf of the victims</a>. Video from the festival shows Travis continuing to perform even as the crowd is clearly in distress and asking him to stop.</p><p>In 2023, Travis was accused of assault after an incident at Nebula, a nightclub in New York City, in which he attacked a sound technician who told him to turn his music down because it was too loud for the venue's size.</p><p>Travis punched the man in the head, and he ultimately needed medical attention. Travis also apparently damaged roughly $12,000 worth of the venue's sound equipment before leaving.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Travis Scott reportedly settles issues with NYC nightclub Nebula. <a href=#>https://t.co/qfBThES8DS</a></p>— Complex (@Complex) <a href=#>April 3, 2023</a></figure><p>Travis was ultimately not arrested over the incident after a settlement was reached in the case.
