today, Sunday, 13th August 2023.</p><p>The Governor of Imo State and the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Hope Uzodinma has dumped his deputy, Placid Njoku, ahead of the November 11, 2023 governorship election in the state.</p><p>Naija News gathered that Uzodinma, on Saturday, officially unveiled his running mate, Chinyere Ekomaru, at a ceremony which took place in Owerri, the state capital.</p><p>Uzodinma while revealing the reason for dumping Njoku and choosing Ekomaru said, “The choice of a new running mate does not mean he has issues with the present Deputy Governor Placid Njoku. The development, he continued, is due to ecumenical and political permutations.”</p><p>Ahead of the governorship election in the state, Uzodinma is hoping to retain power in the state and defeat governorship candidates of the Action Alliance (AA), Lincoln Ogunewe, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Samuel Anyanwu, Labour Party (LP), Senator Athan Achonu and others.</p><p>The Edo State Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, has expressed shock over the allegations made by Governor Godwin Obaseki that he is planning a coup to remove him from power.</p><p>Recall that Obaseki had on Friday alleged that his deputy has a desperate ambition to become the next governor of the state, and he is exploring every possible option to achieve his aim.</p><p>Reacting to the allegations, the deputy governor said it is unimaginable to contemplate a coup against a man who has given him so much latitude to operate, adding that the claims were not only baseless and not true.</p><p>Shaibu, who was quoted to have made these known during a meeting with his personal aides on Saturday morning, pledged his loyalty to the governor, saying that he would never betray his principal or even plan a coup against him.</p><p>Jafaru Sani, the ministerial nomination suggested to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu by former Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, has allegedly been rejected by Governor Uba Sani.</p><p>Naija News reports that El-Rufai had informed President Tinubu of his intention to withdraw from ministerial consideration following the controversy associated with his confirmation at the Senate.</p><p>It was gathered that El-Rufai had nominated Jafaru Sani, who served as a commissioner, as his replacement.</p><p>El-Rufai had allegedly told Tinubu that Governor Sani was in support of Sani’s nomination.</p><p>The Nigerien military and Police have foiled an attempt to burn down the Nigerian Embassy in Niamey, the capital of Niger Republic.</p><p>In a press statement issued on Friday, signed by Dr Liti I. Auwalu on behalf of the Ambassador, the Nigerian Embassy denied a viral report that angry protesters burned the Chancery building.</p><p>The statement explained that even though the protesters tried to gain access to the embassy, the Nigerien security agents managed the situation and dispersed the protesters.</p><p>It added that the Embassy is well-guarded by the Nigerien military and other security authorities.</p><p>The Abdullahi Ganduje-led All Progressives Congress National Working Committee (APC-NWC) has begun moves to seek the nod of the party’s National Executive Committee to ratify the new officers for the NWC.</p><p>It was gathered that the party’s leadership had received the list of nominations from state party chapters in line with the mandate given to the NWC at the last NEC meeting held in Transcorp Hilton in Abuja last week.</p><p>Naija News reports that the APC Vice Chairman (Northwest), Saliu Lukman, and Legal Adviser, Ahmad El-Marzup, resigned, while two NWC members – Senator Abubakar Kyari and Dr. Beta Edu – were nominated as ministers by President Bola Tinubu while a member passed on.</p><p>Top political gladiators close to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and in the Senate have been fingered in the plot to stop the appointment of former Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai, as a minister in the present administration.</p><p>Naija News understands that El-Rufai’s ministerial confirmation was suspended following a security report by the Department of State Security (DSS).</p><p>However, reports have now emerged claiming that the decision to hold back his confirmation emanated from high-wired politics involving the Vice President, Kashim Shettima; Senate President Godswill Akpabio; Tinubu’s Chief of Staff, Femi Gbajabiamila; and the National Security Adviser (NSA), Nuhu Ribadu.</p><p>According to reports, the political ‘strongmen’ around the president are looking far ahead to the post-Tinubu years and are worried a cabinet post could put El-Rufai in a prime position to be a political force.</p><p>Respected Islamic scholar and leader of the Jama’atu Izalatu Bidi’ah wa Ikamatus Sunnah, Nigeria’s prominent Salafi movement, spearheaded a delegation of Nigerian Islamic scholars to Niger Republic.</p><p>Their mission is to mediate and restore tranquillity in the troubled West African nation.</p><p>Following a meeting with President Bola Tinubu, the cleric’s delegation received the president’s consent to engage and liaise with their Nigerien counterparts.</p><p>A source familiar with the situation who spoke with The Punch disclosed that the group was scheduled to land in Niger on Saturday.</p><p>A former President of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo has urged more Christians to get involved in politics.</p><p>He opined that if those with high moral standards should participate in politics it would turn it from a dirty game to a clean one.</p><p>Obasanjo said ordinarily, politics should not be a dirty game but those who participate in it make it dirty.</p><p>The elder statesman said this during the 57th annual convention and 67th anniversary of The Gospel Faith Mission International (GOFAMINT) at Gospel City, Ogunmakin, Ogun State.</p><p>Former Military Governor of Kwara State, Group Captain Salaudeen Adebola Latinwo (Rtd), has died at the age of 80.</p><p>Naija News gathered that Latinwo died in the early hour of Saturday, August 12, in a hospital in the United Kingdom (UK) after a protracted illness.</p><p>Latinwo, a retired Group Captain in the Nigerian Air Force, was born on 12th July 1943 and served as Military Governor of Kwara State between January 1984 and August 1985 under the Military Government of Major General Muhammadu Buhari.</p><p>Born in Offa, Latinwo was part of the pioneer set of officer cadets recruited into the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) in 1963 under the First Chief of Air Staff of the Nigerian Air Force, Colonel Gerhard Kahtz, who was on secondment to the Nigerian Air Force as Head of the German Air Force Assistance Group (GAFAG).</p><p>Indications have emerged that Nigerian Senators reportedly shared N218 million as a “holiday” allowance.</p><p>Naija News understands that each of the 109 senators was paid N2 million before the red chamber went on its seven weeks recess.</p><p>Recall that the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, had on Tuesday during plenary when he mistakenly revealed that tokens had been sent to senators to ‘enjoy’ their recess.</p><p>A video clip showing Akpabio making the blunder had gone viral on social media.</p><p>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
