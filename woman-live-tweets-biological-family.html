But for many people, hanging onto family is really hard. The story of a woman named Albreanna is an incredible reminder of what it means to be surrounded by people you're related to, because she's been looking for them for years.</p><p>Albreanna was adopted as a baby. Her adopted mother passed away when she was 17, and she's mostly been on her own since. She'd sworn that she would find her biological family somehow, but wasn't having any luck. In early July, she shared the story of how it finally happened.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I found my biological family. I’m a daughter. I’m a sister. I’m an aunt. I’m a granddaughter. Bitch I’m a relative!!! A thread...</p>— albreannafindme (@Albreanna89) <a href=#>July 8, 2018</a></figure><p>All she knew was that her mother was Thai and her dad was black. That's not a lot to go on to find an entire family.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>First of all a little about me. I was adopted at birth and never knew my family or where I came from. I just knew my mom was Thai and my dad was black and I was on a mission to find them. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KG4oRR3H1x</a></p>— albreannafindme (@Albreanna89) <a href=#>July 8, 2018</a></figure><p>But then, one day, they found her:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So I get a message from this guy off of <a href=#>@Ancestry</a>. He asked me ?’s like is your name Albreanna? Were you born in SC and is your bday in August? I’m like yeahhh... <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4EqpuW1a5T</a></p>— albreannafindme (@Albreanna89) <a href=#>July 8, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>He’s like, “well I’m your brother and I been looking for you for years”. My heart instantly drops & I’m like don’t play! He’s like yeah & you’re the 3rd youngest of 4. I’m shook <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/O1fsNNp6EO</a></p>— albreannafindme (@Albreanna89) <a href=#>July 8, 2018</a></figure><p>Technology has improved a lot over the last few decades. Ancestry is one of many services that tracks people, and at times even tracks DNA. Albreanna had a family, and they'd been looking for her, too. She was one of four children who shared the same birth mother.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So he gets me on group FaceTime with all my siblings. We all share the same Thai mom but different dads.

So I zoomed over to meet him. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/a5lEO99YBN</a></p>— albreannafindme (@Albreanna89) <a href=#>July 8, 2018</a></figure><p>As a surprise for their mother, Albreanna's siblings decided to bring her to a Fourth of July celebration:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>for the 4th of July just for a family vacay. She had no clue that they found me and was just going to surprise her. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0SfkyNZUGK</a></p>— albreannafindme (@Albreanna89) <a href=#>July 8, 2018</a></figure><p>Before she met her bio mom, Albreanna shared her feelings about what was to come. She was excited, but also scared about how her mom would react. Would she accept her? Would she be mad that her other kids sprung Albreanna on her? It was a scary moment.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So I head out prepared, overwhelmed, shook, excited and scared of rejection all in one feeling. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nA7DiVbGLw</a></p>— albreannafindme (@Albreanna89) <a href=#>July 8, 2018</a></figure><p>You can see all the feelings on her face in this picture:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>But she had a lot of backup. Her siblings felt incredibly familiar to her, and helped her relax. A little.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My siblings and I instantly connect and I can tell they was my blood. 🙄😂 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ybvDHdaIRE</a></p>— albreannafindme (@Albreanna89) <a href=#>July 8, 2018</a></figure><p>Her siblings helped coach her through the encounter:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Fast forward it’s about to go down. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/F3qYRjnfiD</a></p>— albreannafindme (@Albreanna89) <a href=#>July 8, 2018</a></figure><p>They broke the news to Albreanna's mom that she was here, and there wasn't a dry eye in the house. Warning: this video will make you cry:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We meet!

Then she broke down.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>There's some moments from the timeline missing as, I guess, Albreanna and her mom greeted each other. But then they were like old friends:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>She is loud, crazy, and wild just like me! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ygDqNQm9Al</a></p>— albreannafindme (@Albreanna89) <a href=#>July 8, 2018</a></figure><p>And she found out that her mom has been thinking about her all these years, too, and even got a tattoo of her name right after giving her up for adoption:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My mom got my name tatted on her ankle the next day after she gave me up. She told me she was never going to forget about me. And she didn’t. 😩 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/uvBueGl0eN</a></p>— albreannafindme (@Albreanna89) <a href=#>July 8, 2018</a></figure><p>The two had a lot to catch up on:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I am complete. I’m a child who found ppl who look like me. Act like me. It’s crazy that my mom and I share the same mannerism but never grew up around her. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/36CVddy7Mn</a></p>— albreannafindme (@Albreanna89) <a href=#>July 8, 2018</a></figure><p>Wait, was this all an amazing ad for Ancestry.com?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thank you <a href=#>@Ancestry</a> for connecting me with my long lost family.

Not all of them can end so well, but she believes it's worth a try, and is hoping people will share her story to inspire others.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Send me your story!
