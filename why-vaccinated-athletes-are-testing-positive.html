Also, many athletes develop COVID with no symptoms (a "breakthrough" infection), and reports say that athletes are "among the last being tested intensely for the virus."</p><p>This is a problem when athletes are in close proximity to each other all the time. ‚Äî and it could pose a huge issue for something like the Olympics, which is a worldwide event. It could potentially mean another way for the virus to re-spread.</p><p>"These surprising positive tests are a problem for the hosts of large events. In the case of the Olympics, they could trigger an outbreak in the surrounding Japanese population or beyond, to any of the 200 participating nations‚Äîin addition to creating chaos in competitions," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Wall Street Journal writes</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>There must be some pre-defined rules as no one currently knows what is supposed to happen if some foreign athletes test positive on arrival. Are we going to ask athletes to quarantine even if their sessions are held within 2 weeks? <a href=#>https://t.co/exF14zYfhS</a></p>‚Äî Yu Ukai (@ukkaripon) <a href=#>June 22, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>On a more positive note, these "breakthrough" infections that athletes are experiencing are seemingly rare. "Breakthrough infections are believed to be rare, though exactly how rare is unclear.&nbsp;That‚Äôs in large part because most asymptomatic cases would only be detected by the kind of frequent testing that is rarely deployed outside of settings such as sports," WSJ reports.</p><p>At this time, it's unknown how many athletes have had the vaccine. In May 2021, about nine Yankee team members (players, coaches, and people on staff) tested positive for COVID-19 and they were all vaccinated in March with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (which has 66.1 percent efficacy, but is more convenient with its one dose). Others, like pro golfer Jon Rahm (who was not vaccinated) tested positive, and made headlines.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A member of the Ugandan Olympic team tested positive for the coronavirus after arriving at Narita Airport on Saturday night in the first known case of COVID-19 among athletes traveling from abroad. <a href=#>https://t.co/W58Asbngkm</a></p>‚Äî The Japan Times (@japantimes) <a href=#>June 20, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Another factor could be timing and availability, WSJ says. The vaccine has been available to U.S. citizens for a while now, but in some countries, it's only just now being distributed. Plus, athletes need to figure out when to get the shots. If they aren't getting J&J, then both doses need to be scheduled two weeks apart. Athletes also need to take side effects into consideration.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#Breaking</a>: <a href=#>#Jon</a> <a href=#>#Rahm</a> <a href=#>#Tests</a> <a href=#>#Positive</a> for COVID-19, <a href=#>#Forced</a> to WD at the <a href=#>#Memorial</a><br><a href=#>https://t.co/9w7yT4AtuS</a><br><a href=#>#COVID19</a> <a href=#>#GolfRules</a> <a href=#>#Video</a> <a href=#>#Vlog</a> <a href=#>#YouTube</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/H10K6TiTT1</a></p>‚Äî FOGOLF (@FoGOLF) <a href=#>June 11, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>"After shots in a two-dose regimen were secured for Australian athletes, the country‚Äôs divers took care to get their first doses several weeks before trials, to avoid side effects. They held off getting second doses until early June, after the team had been picked," WSJ reports.</p><p>Basically: All vaccines aren't fully effective in preventing COVID (it ranges from about 66 to 95 percent, depending on the vaccine), and athletes are typically in closer proximity to each other than regular folks. Between not having mandatory vaccinations, breakthrough infections even with vaccinated individuals, and the complications with obtaining vaccines and scheduling, it's just easier for athletes to get sick.</p><p>While it's still very rare for a vaccinated athlete to get sick, it's something to note and to keep in mind, considering the rescheduled Summer 2020 Olympics start in July.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6edWampyhnpbBprCMmquhpJWpsrR5wKucZqyVqMGqusZmp6irmam2t7E%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./gregg-alexander-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Gregg Alexander - Age, Family, Bio</a>
