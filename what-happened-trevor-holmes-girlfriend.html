While also being gentle with myself & learning not to regret loving so hard. For giving it all I had. And for finally standing up for me. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä I‚Äôve come to realize that while these wounds from his betrayals may not be my fault, they are indeed my responsibility to heal. So now it is up to ME to show myself the love I‚Äôve been missing. To honor myself. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä I know infidelity & deceit come with a lot of pain & heartache. Taboo or not, I‚Äôve always vowed to be honest, to share my heart & to create space for the hard stuff. I‚Äôm choosing to share my truth in hopes it reaches at least one of you who may be in the same position. I hope it gives you the courage to choose YOU sooner rather than later. To stop ignoring & forgiving constant unhealthy & unfaithful patterns. To not lose respect for yourself in the process of trying to save someone else. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä I hope it gives you the strength to walk away from the table when honesty, faithfulness, respect and love are no longer being served. To never EVER settle. Because you DESERVE all the love & happiness in this world. And because each time one of us stands up for ourselves we stand up for all of us. So‚Ä¶. this is me‚Ä¶ standing up for us all. üôèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä #YourSoulSexy #YSSchallenge #SelfLove #SelfWorth #heartbreak #realtalk #struggletostrength #newbeginnings #breakups #betrayal #healing #infidelity</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>SIERRA - Health & Self-Love</a> (@sierranielsen) on Sep 21, 2018 at 1:16pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In addition to changing his relationship status, Trevor also appears to have switched careers.</h2><p>During Trevor's American Idol days in 2018, the aspiring rockstar, who was 27 years old at the time, said he was a construction worker by day, according to Gold Derby.
