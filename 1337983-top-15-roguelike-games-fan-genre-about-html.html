Roguelike games have steadily gained traction among gamers for having what are arguably the best replay experiences.</p><h2>What are the best roguelike games today?</h2><p class=align-left>Here is a look at some of the most thrilling rogue like games that every fan of the genre should give a try.</p><h3>15. <i>Dicey Dungeons</i> (2019)</h3><p class=align-left><i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dicey Dungeons</a></i> involves one of the most randomized gameplays of all roguelikes. Most of the game's elements are entirely undetermined. These include enemies, levels, layouts, and moves. The roll of a dice determines everything a player does in this game.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f28539125b0f9e75.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Killer dolls: top 10 most horrifying toys from popular culture</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f28539125b0f9e75.jpg><p class=align-left><i>Dicey Dungeons</i> was released in August 2019, making it one of the newest titles on this roguelike games list. At the beginning of each turn, a player rolls their dice and inputs the resulting numbers into slots, some of which only accept even numbers.</p><p class=align-left>Whatever number a player inputs corresponds to the damage they can do, or the items to sacrifice, or people they can heal. It is that random. <i>Dicey Dungeons'</i> gameplay is excellently executed.</p><p class=align-left>One can also play on different levels that contain significantly differently gameplays depending on the character one picks.</p><h3>14. <i>The Binding of Isaac</i> (2011)</h3><p class=align-left><i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Binding of Isaac</a> was</i> released in 2011 to widespread critical acclaim, largely thanks to its history-inspired storyline and groundbreaking roguelike mechanics. The game begins when God sends Isaac's mother a message demanding her son's life.</p><p class=align-left>Isaac gets word of his mother's intentions and flees to the basement of their home for safety, only to confront a horde of bloodthirsty monsters. The game begins as players assume control of Isaac intending to fight their way to survival.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/934f2b52baf88c62.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is the best Yakuza game in the series and where should you start?</span></p></a><h3>13. <i>Spelunky </i>(2008)</h3><p class=align-left>There are few roguelike dungeons games with a following as large as that of <i>Spelunky</i>. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The game</a> is based on an independent two-dimension platform in which players take a journey to the deep underground.</p><p class=align-left>The journey involves fully-randomized, destructible levels teeming with enemies, treasures, and traps. There are also numerous items to help a gamer's quest. These include weapons, jetpacks, and sacrificial pugs.</p><p class=align-left>In this game, the player's death is inevitable and necessary for improving one's skills and finding useful information about obstacles and enemies. Players can die from wide-ranging causes, some of which are rather grisly though presented somewhat comically.</p><h3>12. <i>Skul: The Hero Slayer</i> (2020)</h3><p class=align-left><i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Skul: The Hero Slayer</a></i> is a fascinating pixel-art roguelike that borrows heavily from the hugely popular <i>Dead Cells</i>. The game's main character is known as the collector, similar to the one in <i>Dead Cells</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6c5e358a5210f489.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best harem anime series fans of the genre will know and love</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/98ba7c809807b6c1.jpg><p class=align-left><i>Skul</i>, however, falls short of <i>Dead Cells</i> in terms of animation delivery and fighting combos. In the game, a player controls a creature called Skul in its quest to save 'His Majesty' the demon king from attacks by humans.</p><h3>11. <i>Dark Devotion</i> (2019)</h3><p class=align-left><i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dark Devotion</a></i> is a pixel-art, dark-fantasy role-playing game with roguelike elements. It is a classic side-scroller with challenging components. It is the perfect rogue-like game for people who enjoy dark fantasy, challenge, and a rich story all in one.</p><p class=align-left>Having to travel through an ancient temple where your faith is confronted and questioned, you come across many evil beings meant to put a stop to your gospel truth. Players can have different fighting styles, gain new weapons and armour, and defeat foes throughout each level while indulging in a detailed storyline.</p><h3>10. <i>For the King</i> (2017)</h3><p class=align-left>While the concept of a randomly generated tabletop role-playing game may not sound like a good idea on paper, it works well in <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">For the King</a>, </i>where a gamer gathers their party and embarks on a quest through the random world.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/01b74dfc3462e3f8.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 best Pokemon fan games to try out today</span></p></a><p class=align-left>One builds up their characters with weapons, experience, and treasure. Being highly unpredictable, the game's fun lies in players' self-deception that they have a good grasp on the game and then they get killed by random enemies they failed to sneak past.</p><p class=align-left><i>For the King</i> is, in no small extent, pretty generic, and admittedly not the most original game out there, However, what it does, it does pretty well. Some of the game's upsides involve some unique ideas like the chaos system and completely new campaigns.</p><h3>9. <i>Desktop Dungeons</i> (2010)</h3><p class=align-left><i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Desktop Dungeons</a></i> is the epitome of the roguelike RPG genre. Players assume control of a champion whose task it is to wind their way through the dungeon and take on the final boss. Along the way, one is sure to be confronted by challenging puzzles, various obstacles, and the occasional booby trap.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/934f2b52baf88c62.jpg><p class=align-left>Make it through alive, and you will unlock new character classes, races, and items to aid you on your journey.

Each run involves a player constructing maze-like defences with turrets and walls to slow down the incoming enemies and prevent them from reaching their beacon before you can be extracted.</p><p class=align-left>Once your defences are in place, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the game</a> switches from a top-down perspective to first-person, where you will be tasked with holding off waves of enemies using different class-based weapons, including pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, and alien blasters.</p><p class=align-left>If you manage to come out the other end alive, you are rewarded with some money that can be spent to purchase new defences and upgrades for your character.</p><h3>7. <i>Hades </i>(2018)</h3><p class=align-left><i>Hades </i>is undoubtedly one of the best roguelikes revolving around the traditional hack-and-slash gameplay. This action game was created by SuperGiant Games, the same developers behind other similarly-fascinating titles such as <i>Pyre</i>, <i>Bastion</i>, and <i>Transistor</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d3036a05b79e840a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Which is the best Total War game in the entire series?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Hades's comic-style graphics, combined with stunning and fast-paced animations are just splendid to play and give gamers a serious adrenaline rush. In the game, you play as Zagreus, a British teenager with an attitude and who does not have much love for his dad, Hades.</p><p class=align-left>Zagreus's main mission is to leave hell (his father's home). Since his father will not allow him to leave freely, Zagreus decides to escape, only to realize that doing so is not half as easy as he had imagined.</p><p class=align-left>He encounters scores of demons trying to kill him, at his father's bidding. Players are normally given very little in terms of regenerative ability, a fact that points to an almost inevitable demise.</p><h3>6. <i>Darkest Dungeon</i> (2016)</h3><p class=align-left><i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Darkest Dungeon</a></i> is based on some pretty intense gameplay ideas. In fact, it is actually so nerve-wracking, it could almost be considered a horror roguelike. The game undoubtedly has the tone, gore, and general feeling of hopelessness for gamers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/41f89026d4544078.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 best idle games for Android, iOS and PC to beat boredom</span></p></a><p class=align-left>One plays as a group of disgruntled adventurers who delve into gloomy dungeons, fight horrific abominations, and do the best to hang on to their ever-dwindling sanity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6c5e358a5210f489.png><p class=align-left>Honestly, there is probably no rogue-like out there that can very easily make you feel nervous and outgunned as <i>Darkest Dungeon</i>.</p><p class=align-left>Losing one's money, sanity, and fighters to this entirely bleak gameplay world is an intense and tough experience.

Well, look no further. <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Enter the Gungeon</a></i> takes this concept to new heights as players descend into the depths of a dungeon for a gun that lets them kill their past.</p><p class=align-left>Choose between one of four main characters, each with their own special abilities and mechanics.
