before the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee ( LPDC), the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee (LPPC) and the Body of Benchers can reconsider his life membership.</p><p>The rumour that Mr. Biodun Oyebanji has emerged as the anointed candidate to become the next governor of Ekiti State has been described as ‘gutter politics.’</p><p>Reports from certain political quarters had suggested that Governor Kayode Fayemi and his wife, Erelu Bisi Fayemi had anointed Oyebanji to become the next Governor of Ekiti State.</p><p>Naija News reports that Mr. Oyebanji is the current Secretary to the State Government (SSG).</p><p>At least three persons have been reported dead and many others injured during a massive explosion at the Kubwa village market in Abuja.</p><p>Naija News understands that the explosion, which happened around 7:00 pm on Friday evening, was caused by adulterated kerosene from a tanker near the main market.</p><p>It was learned that properties worth millions of naira were destroyed during the explosion which consumed two shops and other roadside stores.</p><p>The Gombe State Government has reacted to the attack on the convoy of the former governor of the state, Senator Danjuma Goje.</p><p>Naija News had reported that some political thugs attacked the Gombe Central Senator as he was about to enter the state capital for a personal engagement on Friday.</p><p>Goje’s vehicles were attacked with dangerous weapons and bonfires were set on the main road to prevent the Senator from entering into the state.</p><p>President Muhammadu Buhari has been charged again by the House of Representatives Committee on Army to declare bandits terrorists to aid the Nigerian Army to fully clamp down on them.</p><p>The call was made on Friday by
