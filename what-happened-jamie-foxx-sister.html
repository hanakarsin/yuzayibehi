I want to be a professional dancer," she wrote in her bio for the foundation. "My brother has given me a chance to do some special things. I danced in his video 'Blame It.' Iâ€™ve danced on stage at some of his concerts all over the country. And guess what? Iâ€™ve danced at the Grammyâ€™s!"</p><p>"DeOndra was brought into this world in a loving family who treated her like any other family member," a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tribute</a> from the foundation read.&nbsp;</p><p>"They gave her the gifts of complete acceptance, confidence, and knowledge.
