Questions asked at United States Embassy in Kenya vary from applicant to applicant as well as the reason for traveling. Usually, the interview will take approximately five to ten minutes after which the interviewer may accept or reject your application or put your case in ‘Administrative Processing.’</p><p class=align-left>On July 2017, the US Visa appointment was extended from seven days before office interviews to 30 days.
