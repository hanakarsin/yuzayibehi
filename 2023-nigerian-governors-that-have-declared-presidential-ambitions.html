general election draws near, politicians across the country have begun consultations to gain the support of notable persons and other individuals.</h2><p>The race to emerge as the successor of <a href=#><strong>President Muhammadu Buhari</strong></a> in 2023 has started and politicians across the six geopolitical zones have already begun to declare their presidential ambitions.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that there have been calls for the 2023 presidency to be zoned to the Southern region with South West governors and the Pan Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, leading the campaign.</p><p>Amidst the calls for zoning, five sitting governors from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have indicated their interest to lead the country in 2023.</p><p>The governors who have joined the 2023 presidential race include <strong>Nyesom Wike</strong> (Rivers), <strong>Aminu Tambuwal</strong> (Sokoto), <strong>Yahaya Bello</strong> (Kogi), <strong>Dave Umahi</strong> (Ebonyi) and <strong>Bala Mohammed</strong> (Bauchi).</p><p>In this article, we will be looking at the governors who have declared their presidential aspirations and their chances of becoming their party’s flagbearer.</p><h3><strong>Nyesom Wike</strong></h3><p>On March 27, 2022, Governor <strong><a href=#>Nyesom Wike</a></strong> of River state declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>He disclosed this in Markurdi on Sunday during talks with <a href=#><strong>Governor Samuel Ortom</strong></a> and some delegates of the main opposition&nbsp;<strong>Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)</strong>.</p><p>Wike, who is popularly called ‘national governor’ by some PDP members, said he has the courage and resources to dislodge the ruling&nbsp;<strong>All Progressives Congress (APC)</strong>&nbsp;from power at the ballot box.</p><p>According to the Rivers governor, he would tackle the festering insecurity in the country and engender rule of law.</p><p>Speaking further, <strong><a href=#>Wike berated some of the PDP presidential aspirants</a></strong> for neglecting the opposition party when their expertise and experience was really needed.</p><p>In a veiled reference to former Vice President <strong>Atiku Abubakar</strong> and former Senate President <strong>Bukola Saraki</strong>, Wike blamed the two chieftains for the party’s defeat in the 2015 presidential election.</p><p>In an interview on Channels Television on Monday, Wike said he will <a href=#><strong>forfeit his</strong> presidential ambition</a> if the PDP decides to zone its presidential ticket to the north.</p><h3><strong>Aminu Tambuwal</strong></h3><p>The Governor of Sokoto State, <strong><a href=#>Aminu Tambuwal</a></strong>, on 31 January, <strong><a href=#>declared his intention</a></strong> to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.</p><p>Tambuwal who disclosed his intention after a stakeholders’ meeting in Sokoto would be seeking to clinch the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party.</p><p>The PDP chieftain while speaking at the declaration said he is prepared and ready to fix the challenges rocking the progress of the country.</p><p>Tambuwal further stated that he has not only distinguished himself as a Speaker of the House of Reps without any blemish or corruption tag.</p><p>Meanwhile, a group of friends led by Aree Olumiyiwa Akinboro have <strong><a href=#>purchased the PDP Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms</a></strong> for Tambuwal to contest in the forthcoming presidential election.</p><p>Also, Tambuwal has said he would meet with Atiku Abubakar on the possibility of presenting a consensus candidate for the PDP.</p><p>This is coming a few days after Tambuwal, former president of the senate, Bukola Saraki, the governor of Bauchi State, Bala Mohammed <strong><a href=#>agreed to present a consensus candidate</a></strong> for PDP.</p><h3><strong>Yahaya Bello</strong></h3><p>On<span class="mvp-post-date updated"> January 20 2022, </span>Governor <strong><a href=#>Yahaya Bello</a></strong> of Kogi State has announced his <strong><a href=#>intention to run for the 2023 presidency</a></strong> under the APC.</p><p>He made the declaration during a meeting with APC legislators as well as women groups from the North-East subregion which was held in Bauchi at Hazibal hotel on Thursday.</p><p>The governor disclosed that he intends to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2033 because the country deserves better and more purposeful leadership from the youth.</p><p>Meanwhile, governor Bello has thrown his weight behind the <strong><a href=#>option for a northern candidate to take over</a></strong> from President Buhari in 2023.</p><p>According to the governor, the north-central deserves a shot at the presidency than the South-east.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports the governor made the submission while speaking with State House correspondents in Abuja shortly after a meeting with the President.</p><p>Though he agreed that both zones have not had too many chances at leading the Nation, the governor insisted that the north-central is more deserving of the post in 2023 and other regions should await their turn.</p><h3><strong>Dave Umahi</strong></h3><p>On 11 January, <strong><a href=#>Governor Dave Umahi</a></strong>&nbsp;of Ebonyi State has confirmed he has informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his 2023 presidential ambition.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that the Ebonyi governor made this known in a chat with State Correspondents after a meeting with Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.</p><p>The Chairman of the South-East Governors Forum added that he is not disturbed about the presidential ambition of the APC National Leader and former Lagos State Governor,&nbsp;<strong>Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.</strong></p><h3><strong>Bala Mohammed</strong></h3><p>The Governor of Bauchi State, <strong><a href=#>Bala Mohammed</a></strong>, visited former President <strong><a href=#>Goodluck Jonathan</a></strong> to inform him of <a href=#>his presidential ambition</a>.</p><p>The Peoples Democratic Party governor visited the former President at his Abuja residence on Thursday, January 11, 2022.</p><p>Mohammed, who had earlier set up a consultation committee, disclosed that he has received the report of the committee.</p><p>He added that he would support former Vice President, <a href=#><strong>Atiku Abubakar</strong></a> if eventually emerges as the candidate of the party as he is not desperate.</p><p>The governor has also formed a unity team with former&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Senate President Bukola Saraki</a></strong>and&nbsp;Governor&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Aminu Tambuwal</a></strong> of Sokoto in order to reach a consensus among themselves.</p><p class=postsid
